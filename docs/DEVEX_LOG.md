Operation: GET /api/v1/dex/market/rwa/tokens (binanceChainId=56, platformId=ondo)
Goal: -
Expected: statusInfo.marketStatus one of the documented enum values (premarket | regular | postmarket | overnight | closed | pause)
Observed: statusInfo.marketStatus = "offhours" on 31 of the tokens in this response (e.g. underlyingTicker NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOGL)
HTTP/provider code: 200 / "0"
Latency: 1524ms
Workaround: -
Was docs behavior accurate?: No - "offhours" is not in the documented marketStatus enum.
Suggested fix: -
Evidence ref: evidence.provider_call.id = 7f22e069-4cb0-47ae-b09b-a8e41cba0381, probe_run_id = e2e78fa9-6ff2-4daa-877b-592439128c5e

Goal: -

Operation: GET /api/v1/dex/market/rwa/tokens (binanceChainId=56, platformId=ondo)
Goal: -
Expected: underlyingName a non-null string
Observed: underlyingName = null on the same 3 tokens as the assetType observation above (tokenContractAddress 0xebe1408a7cce4f38de15467e5139c3d82e4641f8 / underlyingTicker SYSB, 0xb0d7d4b65a654d43f91272bb94e011ce6812a2ef / SECU, 0x85b53a9344884ae428e0e15f05a1819d280d4be7 / HYGW)

Workaround: -
Was docs behavior accurate?: No - underlyingName is documented as a string, not nullable.

### 2026-09-28 (DEC-021 - comprehensive audit of all stored /rwa/tokens responses)

Docs URL/page: https://web3.binance.com/en/dev-docs/catalog/web3-wallet/api/rest-api/rwa-data (Get RWA Token List, statusInfo.marketStatus)
Operation: GET /api/v1/dex/market/rwa/tokens (binanceChainId=56, platformId=ondo)
Goal: -
Expected: statusInfo.marketStatus one of the documented enum values (premarket | regular | postmarket | overnight | offhours | closed | pause)
Observed: statusInfo.marketStatus = "paused" on 92 of the tokens in this response (e.g. tokenContractAddress 0x47b36ddb9dd12a8411f78226f55e8c3f0d65481f). Also observed in this same audit: across all 976 tokens captured so far (both probe runs, both platforms), the documented value "pause" (singular) has never once appeared - only "paused".
HTTP/provider code: 200 / "0"
Latency: 1384ms
Workaround: -
Was docs behavior accurate?: No - "paused" is not in the documented marketStatus enum; the closest documented value, "pause", has zero live occurrences across every stored response.
Suggested fix: -
Evidence ref: evidence.provider_call.id = f4192f57-f42d-461e-9706-283e30729d8d, probe_run_id = 3ffea1da-004d-4a2d-b0ec-1639aceee3f5
